# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement an automated vendor package management system for the Elixir learning app. The system will automatically download and manage external JavaScript packages in the assets/vendor directory during development, while keeping these files excluded from git version control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want vendor packages to be automatically downloaded during development setup, so that I don't need to manually manage external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the development setup THEN the system SHALL automatically download all required vendor packages to assets/vendor/
2. WHEN vendor packages are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to obtain them
3. WHEN the development environment starts THEN the system SHALL verify that all required vendor packages are present

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple command to update vendor packages, so that I can easily maintain up-to-date external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the vendor update command THEN the system SHALL download the latest versions of all configured vendor packages
2. WHEN a vendor package fails to download THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message with troubleshooting steps
3. WHEN vendor packages are updated THEN the system SHALL log which packages were updated and their versions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want vendor package configuration to be version controlled, so that all team members use the same external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vendor packages are configured THEN the configuration file SHALL be tracked in version control
2. WHEN a new developer joins the project THEN they SHALL be able to download the exact same vendor packages using the configuration
3. WHEN vendor package URLs or versions change THEN the configuration SHALL be easily updatable through the config file

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the vendor package system to integrate with existing build processes, so that it works seamlessly with the current development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Phoenix development server starts THEN vendor packages SHALL be available without additional manual steps
2. WHEN assets are compiled THEN the system SHALL include vendor packages in the build process
3. WHEN running in production THEN vendor packages SHALL be properly included in the asset pipeline
